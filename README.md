# memory-whole

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/net.clojars.escherize/memory-whole.svg)](https://clojars.org/net.clojars.escherize/memory-whole)

A Clojure library to leverage actual data to build runtime function annotations.

## How it works

1. `mem/trace` or `mem/deftrace` a function

Traced functions will save their inputs/outputs to a local sqlite db by default, or whatever db you point it at.

2. call the function multiple times in the usual way

TODO: As functions begin putting their values into the memory whole, we can generate specs or malli schema from the raw data.

3. use tools to generate specifications for your function

TODO: Come up with some nice way to use this information during development.

## TODO

1. [x] finish tracing
   1. [x] figure out how to get a hold of source from var
   2. [x] proper collisions between sources
   3. [x] copy over sql-lite functions
   4. [x] write tests
2. [ ] generate data shapes
   0. [ ] delineate function generations by ast hash
   How many samples would be good? How accurate should the generation be? 
   1. [ ] malli
   2. [ ] spec
3. [ ] how to view these things?
   1. clj-kondo, like:  ?
   2. just call `mem/spec-for` ?
